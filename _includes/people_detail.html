                    <p align="justify">I am a recent Barnard graduate (Class of 2021!) who majored in Biochemistry. Originally from Queens, New York, Barnard has always felt like my home away from home throughout the four years that I attended as a student. During my time at Barnard, I worked in the Austin lab and researched a neuronal protein that is implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases. As part of my gap years, I am excited to work in the Lopatkin lab to study antibiotic resistance. My previous work and the work that I will do in the Lopatkin lab will allow me to become a better learner, thinker, and researcher, and I ultimately hope to apply these skills as a future physician. Outside the lab, you can find me playing with my two cats, or cooking in the kitchen! </p>
